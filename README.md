This is a Python script of my analysis and modeling of the House [Prices Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It includes some basic data analysis and descriptions, dealing with missing values, outliers and scaling. I tried several regression machine learning methods and LassoCV seems to work the best. I also give references to several excellent public kernels on Kaggle, there is much to learn from those and others.
